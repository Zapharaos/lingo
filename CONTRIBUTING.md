# Contributing

## Introduction

We appreciate your interest in considering contributing to lingo.
Community contributions mean a lot to us.

## Contributions we need

You may already know how you'd like to contribute, whether it's a fix for a bug you
encountered, or a new feature your team wants to use.

If you don't know where to start, consider improving
documentation, bug triaging, and writing tutorials are all examples of
helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through
[help-wanted
issues](https://github.com/Zapharaos/lingo/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22).

Never contributed to open source before? Here are a couple of friendly
tutorials:

## Getting Started

Here's how to get started with your code contribution:

1.  Create your own fork of lingo
2.  Do the changes in your fork
3.  While developing, make sure the tests pass by running `make test-unit`.
> Note: Do not forget to write new tests or update existing ones depending on your contribution.
4.  If you like the change and think the project could use it, send a
    pull request

## Testing

### Running tests

Call `make test-unit` to run all tests.

### Troubleshooting

If you get any errors when running `make test-unit`, make sure
that you are using supported versions of go.

### Linting

Call `make lint` to run the linter on the codebase. This will help ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding standards.

## How to Report a Bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1.  What version of lingo are you using?
2.  What did you do?
3.  What did you expect to see?
4.  What did you see instead?

## Suggest a feature or enhancement

If you'd like to contribute a new feature, make sure you check our
issue list to see if someone has already proposed it. Work may already
be underway on the feature you want or we may have rejected a
feature like it already.

If you don't see anything, open a new issue that describes the feature
you would like and how it should work.

## Code review process

The core team regularly looks at pull requests. We will provide
feedback as soon as possible. After receiving our feedback, please respond
within two weeks. After that time, we may close your PR if it isn't
showing any activity.
